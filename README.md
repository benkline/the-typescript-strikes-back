# Software Wars, A New App 

The goal with this project is to develop a simple web application that leverages data from the Star Wars API. The requirements are to:

* List all the Star Wars related planets (via GET /api/planets ) and allow users to select an individual planet to display related information about the selected planet - name diameter, climate, terrain, population, etc... 
* Users should also see a list of people that have lived on the selected planet (via the residents results array from GET /api/planets). 
* Users should have the ability to select an individual person from the selected planetâ€™s list of people. When the person is selected, information about that person should be displayed (e.g. hair color, skin color, gender, etc.).  

This app uses the Angular UI framework to implement the project [discuss the overall approach and how they separated out components and application logic.]

[How long did this take to make] - 

30 min - Research, CLI new and add Material, write README 
45 Min - MVP with Mocked Data

* Any challenges faced, and how you overcame them

* Reasoning behind any particular design decisions

* Gaps in the code, or improvements you would make in the future, if you had time

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.1.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
